TASK #1
Enhanced Maze Navigation with Multiple Goals
● Description: Modify the given Best-First Search to find a path through a maze
with multiple goal points. The algorithm should visit all goal points and return
the shortest path covering all goals.
● Challenge: The maze will have several dead ends and multiple goal points at
different locations.
TASK #2
Implement an A* Search where the edge costs change dynamically at random intervals.
The algorithm should adapt to these changes and always find the optimal path.
Recompute and adjust paths in real time without restarting the algorithm from
scratch.
TASK #3
Delivery Route Optimization with Time Windows
● Description: Using the Greedy Best-First Search, optimize delivery routes for a
set of delivery points. Each delivery point has a specific time window for
delivery, and the algorithm must prioritize those with stricter deadlines.
● Challenge: Ensure that the algorithm handles time constraints efficiently while
minimizing total travel distance.
