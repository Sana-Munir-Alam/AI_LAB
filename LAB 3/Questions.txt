Task # 1
A company’s security system consists of nine critical components (A through I). Each component can be either safe or vulnerable due to security flaws. A security agent is
responsible for scanning the entire system, identifying vulnerabilities, and patching them to prevent attacks.
You are tasked with simulating a cybersecurity exercise using the given environment and agent. 
Complete the following steps:
○ Initial System Check:
  - The system environment is initialized with random vulnerabilities.
  - Display the initial state of the system, showing which components are safe and which are vulnerable.
○ System Scan:
The security agent scans each component. 
  - If a component is vulnerable, the agent logs a warning and adds it to a list for patching.
  - If it is secure, a success message is logged.
○ Patching Vulnerabilities:
  - After the scan, the agent patches all vulnerable components, marking them as safe. Display messages indicating which components have been patched.
○ Final System Check:
  - Display the system’s final state, confirming that all vulnerabilities have been patched.

Task # 2
A data center runs multiple servers, each hosting different services. These services are either underloaded, balanced, or overloaded based on the system's load.
The Load Balancer Agent is responsible for redistributing tasks across the servers to ensure optimal system performance.
Task:
● Create a system with 5 servers.
● Each server has a load state of "Underloaded", "Balanced", or "Overloaded".
● The Load Balancer Agent must scan the system and move tasks from overloaded servers to underloaded ones to balance the load.
● After balancing the load, display the updated load status of each server.


Task # 3
A network of servers has a set of backup tasks that need to be completed regularly. Some backups are successful, while others fail.
The Backup Management Agent is responsible for ensuring all failed backups are retried and completed.
Task:
● Create a list of backup tasks with either "Completed" or "Failed" statuses.
● The Backup Management Agent scans for failed backups and retries them.
● After retrying, display the updated task statuses.

Task # 4 (utility based agent)
A cybersecurity exercise is being conducted for a company’s security system, which consists
of nine critical components (A through I). Each component of the system can either be Safe
or have Vulnerabilities of varying severity. The company wants to ensure that its system
remains secure, but it only has access to a basic security service that can patch Low Risk
Vulnerabilities. High Risk Vulnerabilities require purchasing a premium security service to
patch.
In this scenario, the goal is to simulate how a Utility-Based Security Agent scans and
patches the system based on the vulnerabilities detected and the available resources
(limited patching service).
● Initial System Check:
○ Initialize the system environment with random vulnerabilities (Safe, Low Risk
Vulnerable, and High Risk Vulnerable).
○ Display the initial state of the system, showing which components are Safe
and which have Vulnerabilities.

● System Scan:
○ The security agent will scan each component.
○ If a component is Vulnerable, the agent logs a warning.
○ If it is Safe, a success message is logged.
● Patching Vulnerabilities:
○ The agent will patch all Low Risk Vulnerabilities.
○ The agent will log a message for High Risk Vulnerabilities indicating the need
for premium service to patch them.
● Final System Check:
○ Display the system’s final state to confirm that all Low Risk Vulnerabilities have been patched.
○ The High Risk Vulnerabilities will remain unresolved unless the premium service is purchased.


Task # 5 (Goal based agent)
In a hospital, a delivery robot is tasked with delivering medicines to patients, assisting
nurses, and performing other related activities in an efficient manner. The goal of the robot is
to automatically move through hospital corridors, pick up medicines, deliver them to the
correct patient rooms, and perform various tasks such as scanning patient IDs or alerting
staff.
● Components:
○ Agent: The hospital delivery robot, which can move around, interact with patient rooms, pick up medicines, deliver them, and alert nurses or doctors when needed.
● Environment: The hospital layout, including:
○ Corridors
○ Patient rooms
○ Nurse stations
○ Medicine storage areas
● Actions:
○ Move to a location (room, station, etc.).
○ Pick up medicine from storage.
○ Deliver medicine to the patient’s room.
○ Scan patient ID for verification.
○ Alert staff for critical situations.
● Perceptions:
○ Room numbers (where the robot should deliver the medicine).
○ Patient schedules (timing for when patients need their medicines).
○ Medicine type (specific medicines to be delivered to patients).
○ Staff availability (alerts if staff assistance is needed).

Goal-Based Agent Approach:
Goal: Deliver medicine to patients based on a schedule and room number, while ensuring all
deliveries are correctly made. The robot must scan the patient's ID before delivering and
alert nurses or doctors if needed.



Task # 6
In a building with multiple rooms, a firefighting robot has been deployed to save lives and
prevent damage. The building is represented by a 3x3 grid, where each cell corresponds to
a room. Some rooms contain fires, and others are safe.
● The robot starts at room 'a' and must move across all rooms, from 'a' to 'j', detecting and extinguishing any fires along the way.
● The robot needs to be aware of which rooms have fire and must extinguish them by changing the room’s status from "fire" to "safe."
● The robot needs to continuously display the environment’s status after each move and indicate when fires are detected and extinguished.
● Initialization:
○ Implement a 3x3 grid where rooms 'a', 'b', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h' are safe (no fire), and rooms 'c', 'e', 'j' contain fires.
○ The robot starts at room 'a' and follows a predefined path: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j'].
● Robot Movement:
○ The robot should move from room to room in the specified path.
○ At each room, the robot must check if there is a fire:
■ If there is a fire, extinguish it and update the room's status to safe.
■ If there is no fire, move to the next room.

● Displaying the Environment:
○ After each move, display the current status of the environment.
○ Use symbols like " " for fire and " " (space) for a safe room to represent the environment visually.

● Final Output:
○ After the robot has completed its movement, display the final status of all rooms (with all fires extinguished).
