TASK #1 
Convert the following searching algorithms into agent-based models:
- Depth-Limited Search (DLS): Implement as a Goal-Based Agent to explore the graph up to a specified depth limit.
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Implement as a Utility-Based Agent to find the goal with the minimum cost path.

TASK # 2
Traveling Salesman Problem:
Given a set of cities and distances between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible
route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. Like any problem, which can be optimized,
there must be a cost function. In the context of TSP, total distance traveled must be reduced as much as possible.
Consider the below matrix representing the distances (Cost) between the cities. Find the shortest possible route 
that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
dist = {
    1: {2: 10, 3: 15, 4: 20},
    2: {1: 10, 3: 35, 4: 25},
    3: {1: 15, 2: 35, 4: 30},
    4: {1: 20, 2: 25, 3: 30}
}

TASK # 3
Implement Iterative deepening DFS  on graph and tree.
